Beyond the tech world that often consumes our daily lives, there are unique experiences that profoundly enrich us. Today marks a special milestone: **our dog Leo's first birthday**. Reflecting on the past nine months since we welcomed him into our home, I want to share my personal experience—one that is shaped by my own characteristics, emotions, and challenges.

I acknowledge that dog ownership is a subjective journey; each person’s experience will differ based on their lifestyle, temperament, and prior experience with pets. For my wife and me, Leo is our first dog, and we were completely inexperienced. Our journey is one from an amateur's perspective, filled with learning curves, surprises, and valuable lessons.

## The Decision to Welcome Leo

My wife and I had recently developed an affection for dogs, often finding joy in seeing them on the streets. A friend of ours owned a small dog, and each encounter with her deepened our appreciation for these companions. This led us to ponder: *should we bring a dog into our lives?*

Such a decision isn't made lightly. Owning a dog comes with significant responsibilities. We deliberated for about a year, assessing our life circumstances and determining if a dog would fit well. While we anticipated challenges, the thought of having a loyal companion by our side, offering affection and receiving it in return, convinced us it was worth pursuing.

## The Early Days with Leo

After deciding to proceed, we found a reputable breeder—a kind woman residing in a village near Berlin. We visited her multiple times, and during these visits, a particular puppy captured our hearts. Initially named Hermann by the breeder, we felt the name was a bit old-fashioned. Inspired by the beautiful animated movie "Leo," we decided to rename him **Leo**.

The initial days were more challenging than we had imagined. The biggest hurdle for me was **adapting to the change**. My life was undergoing a significant transformation. I was taking on a substantial responsibility, and I feared for my comfort and freedom. Having something new in our home—an unfamiliar creature we couldn't yet understand—was daunting.

Despite watching several YouTube videos on dog training, the reality was different. Taking Leo outside for potty breaks was challenging; everything was new to him, and he was easily distracted. Sometimes, we'd wait for half an hour before he finally relieved himself. Occasionally, he had accidents indoors, which was frustrating.

The most distressing experience was when Leo fell ill, coughing continuously for hours. Unsure of what to do, we rushed him to the vet, where he received injections, and we were handed a bill amounting to hundreds of euros. This was another shock amidst the challenges we were already facing.

At one point, we seriously considered finding a new owner for him, doubting our abilities as pet parents. However, love doesn't work that way. After a week, we dismissed the idea, even though our friends also initially agreed that we might not be ready for the responsibility.

## The Journey Forward

The first few months were a rollercoaster of emotions. But amidst the challenges, we couldn't overlook how cute and loving Leo was. As time passed, we learned more about him—how to care for him, love him, and receive love in return. Now, a year later, our bond with Leo has only grown stronger. He's become an integral part of our family. I often call him **"son"** and he'll always be our baby as long as he's with us.

## Final Reflections

Owning a dog isn't for everyone. It's not solely about the joys; like anything in life, it comes with its pros and cons. As a first-time owner, you'll experience significant changes that require acceptance and time. This is especially evident for those without prior experience in caregiving. You must embrace the responsibility you've willingly taken on. Once you navigate through the initial challenges, the journey ahead is filled with **love and joy**.

In conclusion, while the initial stages of dog ownership can be overwhelming, the bond that forms over time makes the journey worthwhile. Leo has brought immeasurable joy into our lives, and we look forward to many more years of companionship with him.
