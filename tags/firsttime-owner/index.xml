      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://masoodazizi.com/images/blog-post-cover-leo-first-year.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Leo: Our Maltipoo Dog&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the tech world that often consumes our daily lives, there are unique experiences that profoundly enrich us. Today marks a special milestone: our dog Leo&amp;rsquo;s first birthday. Reflecting on the past nine months since we welcomed him into our home, I want to share my personal experience—one that is shaped by my own characteristics, emotions, and challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I acknowledge that dog ownership is a subjective journey; each person’s experience will differ based on their lifestyle, temperament, and prior experience with pets. For my wife and me, Leo is our first dog, and we were completely inexperienced. Our journey is one from an amateur&amp;rsquo;s perspective, filled with learning curves, surprises, and valuable lessons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
